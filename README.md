I have grown increasingly frusterated with bugs in software that I use everyday in my professional and personal life. I have decided to document these bugs in an effort to share my rage with the world. While my inclination is to flame/shame the people involved, I will be making every effort to provide professional, accurate, and complete bug reports.
